/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any styles
 * defined in the other CSS/SCSS files in this directory. It is generally better to create a new
 * file per style scope.
 *
 * from Bower:
 * this is weird and needs special treatment:
 *= require_tree ../../../vendor/assets/bower_components/jquery-ui/themes/base
 * these are resolved thanks to bower-rails:
 *= require bootstrap-sass-official
 *= require seiyria-bootstrap-slider
 *
 * standard rails:
 *= require_tree .
 *= require_tree ../../../lib/assets/stylesheets
 *= require_tree ../../../vendor/assets/stylesheets
 *= require_self
