/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any styles
 * defined in the other CSS/SCSS files in this directory. It is generally better to create a new
 * file per style scope.
 *
 * project rails:
 *= require fonts
 *
 * from Bower:
 * this is weird and needs special treatment:
 * disabled...
 * enabled:
 * note that bower:clean will blow this away!
 *= dontrequire_tree ../../../vendor/assets/bower_components/jquery-ui/themes/base
 * these are resolved thanks to bower-rails:
 *= dontrequire bootstrap-sass-official
 *= dontrequire ../../../client/node_modules/bootstrap-datepicker/dist/css/bootstrap-datepicker.css
 *= dontrequire ../../../client/node_modules/jquery-timepicker/jquery.timepicker.css
 *= dontrequire ../../../client/node_modules/select2/dist/css/select2.css
 *= dontrequire ../../../client/node_modules/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css
 *
 * standard rails:
 *= require_tree .
 *= require webpack-bundle
 *= require_tree ../../../lib/assets/stylesheets
 *= require_tree ../../../vendor/assets/stylesheets
 *= require_self
