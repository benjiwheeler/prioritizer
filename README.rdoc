Idea is that you have many of these, attached to prompts in your day.

Your main duties:
* when your situation changes -- you come back from lunch, you put your kids
to bed, etc. -- open that prompt.
* add items to lenses as you think of them

"All", aka "Any", points to logic that picks all tasks; it's not a real tag.

Tasks *must* have a discrete number (usually one) of tags.
A task *cannot* be tagged directly with "all" or "any".
